Cobol Examples

Work-in-progress for the Daffodil implementation of Cobol.
IBM DFDL has great Cobol support, but Daffodil does not as yet. 

Small examples here should become useful and portable once Daffodil finishes
the necessary DFDL features.

Uses a mixture of types (strings, numbers, dates), Cobol representations - packed and zoned decimal, virtual decimal points.
